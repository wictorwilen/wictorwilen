### Hi and welcome!

Wictor Wilen works as Principal PM (product manager) in the [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com) Microsoft 365 people platform team, creating highly personalized and AI driven experiences that adapt to the unique interests of our users and the relationships that they have with other people and their content. Formerly member of the Microsoft Regional Director network and a SharePoint MVP for twelve years, as well as an author and a well known international speaker. Before joining the Microsoft mothership I spent two and a half decades as a consultant professional on top of the Microsoft stack, from developer, to architect to innovation lead at global consulting firms.
